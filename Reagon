I F I’D GOTTEN THE JOB I WANTED at Montgomery Ward, I suppose I would never have left Illinois.

I’ve often wondered at how lives are shaped by what seem like small and inconsequential events, how an apparently random turn in the road can lead you a long way from where you intended to go—and a long way from wherever you expected to go. For me, the first of these turns occurred in the summer of 1932, in the abyss of the Depression.

They were cheerless, desperate days. I don’t think anyone who did not live
through the Depression can ever understand how difficult it was. In the words of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, “the country was dying by inches.” There were millions
of people out of work. The unemployment rate across the country was over
twenty-six percent. Every day the radio crackled with announcements warning
people not to leave home in search of work because, the announcer said, there
were no jobs to be found anywhere. There were no jobs, and for many, it seemed
as if there was no hope.
